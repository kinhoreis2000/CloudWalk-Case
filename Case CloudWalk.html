<div class="jumbotron text-center">
  <h1>Cloudwalk case</h1>
  <p>First, we are deviding this case in basically three steps:</p>
  <div>
    <p>1- Understand the industry</p>
  </div>
    <p>2- Get your hands durty</p> 
</div>  
    <p>3- Solve the problem</p>  
  </div> 
</div>
  
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>1-Understand the industry</h3>
      <p>First of all, it is important to define what is an acquire company. </p>
      <p>When talking about payment options, we have to deal with some digital issues (If it is an on-line payment). There is where companies like CloudWalk appears.
        So, it is a good way to define that kind of credit or debit payment environment as a market that specializes in processing payments. </p>
        <p>And with that in mind, it gets easier to explain how those companies works.</p>
        <img src="processing-scheme.webp" alt="How the process works" width="550px">
        <p>First, the companies receive the payment information from a costumer (Stores, Parks, supermarket,etc) then they send that information to the bank or other monetary responsible, which will approve the payment method.
            Futhermore, the acquirer is responsible to send the monetary value to the costumer.
            </p>
            <h4>1.1-Difference between acquirer, sub-acquirer and payment gateway</h4>
            <p>While Acquire companies are really independent when talking about the payment money flow, the sub–acquire companies deal with other integration problems, which can make that kind of business more unsustainable to huge companies, in detriment of those issues, sub–acquire needs to get higher rates charging each transaction. Nonetheless, to small stores the low implementation cost gets more attractable. </p>
            <p>A payment gateway, on the other hand, is a mechanism that sends information about purchases made in your store at the point of sale. They are responsible for consolidating most of the transactions and organizing the money flow to the main players of the acquire market. </p>
            <h4>1.2-How the supply chain fits into the ecosystem of means of payments</h4>
            <p>The supply chain, or Supply Chain, is the set of methods and processes that involve the flow of goods from the purchase of raw materials to the final consumer. The activities included within this process include the purchase of raw materials, packaging, product manufacturing, storage, transportation, distribution, sale and customer service. It is also noticed that there is a relationship between the theme and the industry.</p>
            <img src="sc management.webp" alt="Suply Chain management" width="300">
            <p>It is easy to see that this network acts directly in the areas of customer, reseller, and supplier. To facilitate the use of credit among stakeholders, companies such as CloudWalk help large companies to buy products from suppliers, while sub-acquire helps small, medium, and large entrepreneurs to buy from retailers. It is a fully connected, complex, and objective network, which without the presence of different payment methods would not be possible.</p>
            <h4>1.3-How the agile delivery of the card machine would benefit everyone involved.</h4>
            <p>With the agility in obtaining payment machines, it is possible to obtain more objective and accurate results in the supply chain. Even causing an optimization of time and, consequently, of the money involved. The more customers have different forms of payment and the flow of money is easily drained, this certainly impacts from the purchase of raw materials to the material developed for the customer.</p>

      <h3>2-Get your hands durty</h3>
      <p>The following data analysis were made at Python and Excel, both great analitic tools</p>
      <img src="Gráfico python.webp" alt="Image python"width="500">
      <p>The first thing I realize is that I will have to work with the average delivery days and try to work in the best way to solve the problem. It is important that we work with the cities that showed the worst use of time.</p>
      <p>In order to obtain more information with the data obtained, a graphic study was carried out, and we observed that the largest cities in numbers of orders are São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Bahia.</p>
      <img src="qtd de pedidos.webp" alt="Amount of solicitations"width="600
      ">

      <p>Despite less expressive numbers in orders, the states that presented the longest delivery times were Acre, Pará, Maranhão and Piaui. Not coincidentally all from the North/Northeast region.</p>
      <img src="diferença data de crialçao e data de chegada.webp" alt="difference between the criation and delivery date"width=600>
      <p>Another variable that I thought it was important to mention is the difference between the estimated time of delivery and the average time spent for this delivery. In this way, we can see which states we are having problems correctly measuring the expected delivery date. delay. Similarly, for positive numbers there is an advance in delivery time. Realize that a totally different situation is found, causing a strangeness in some cities.</p>
      <img src="diferença data estimada e data destino.webp" alt="Estimated date"width=600>
      <p>Note that this time the leader is Mato Grosso do Sul, Amazonas and Tocantins, showing a pattern of repetition of delay in the northern region of the country, with both the estimated time wrong and delay in arrival days. There is an urgent need for an action plan in the North/Northeast region.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Solve the problem</h3>        
      <p>I am a person who constantly uses organizational and plan-making tools. Therefore, I believe it is important to base our expectations on the data studied, which show us an urgency to change some procedure in the less densely populated region of the country. Therefore, we will be using a tool called 5 whys </p>
      <p>First of all, a meeting with the head of logistics and product delivery is necessary. In this way, we will better understand the reason for these delays in the most remote regions of the country</p>
      <p>The 5 whys help us to identify the root of the problem found, which would be the wrong estimate and superior delivery time in that region.</p>
      <p><b> 1- Why are we making the wrong estimate?</b></p>
      <p>Few orders from the region, lack of data compromise the analysis of solutions</p>
      <p><b>2- Why do we have few orders in the region?</b></p>
      <p>Because the region is less densely populated and not economically favored. Therefore, fewer orders are placed and those that are placed are delayed.</p>
      <p><b>3- Why is the weather specifically longer there?</b></p>
      <p>As a native resident of the region, I believe I have the authority to speak about the unsafe conditions of the roads and highways. If the transport of our product is being done there, it may cause delays</p>
      <p><b>4- Why are the roads and highways not in a good situation?</b></p>
      <p>Due to lack of investment in infrastructure and disadvantages of the northern region</p>
      <p><b>5- Why does the North/Northeast region lack investment?</b></p>
      <p>Due to low competition and as well as abstentions from initiatives in other forms of transport</p>
    </div>
      <p>With all the study carried out above, I believe that the best solution for cloudwalk is to invest in alternative means of delivery to the north/northeast region. </p>
